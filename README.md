A template for how to resurrect/keeps running an Android service in the background even when the user kills the service.

This template has the following four ways to revive the service,

1. User starts the app again.
2. User presses power key to turn on the screen.
3. User restarts the phone.
4. 10 seconds passed after anything/anyone kills our service.

Here is a [detailed explanation](http://engineereverything.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/android-how-to-resurrectstay-in-the-background-even-the-user-kills-the-app/) on the project.
